# UE23CS251B : Microprocessor and Computer Architecture Laboratory

This repository contains code and detailed problem statements for the 8 weeks of laboratory exercises conducted during the fourth semester as part of the **Microprocessor and Computer Architecture (MPCA)** course.

## Repository Overview

The repository is structured into weekly folders, each dedicated to the laboratory exercises for a specific week.

### Folders

- **Labs(0-7)**: Contains the problem statements and code solutions for the week.
- **OpenMP**: Parallel programming code exercise done as part of theory syllabus.
- **Assignment folders**: These contain the problem statements provided in class along with my corresponding solutions for the assigned tasks.

## About the Course

The course, _UE23CS251B : Microprocessor and Computer Architecture_, focuses on hands-on learning of fundamental MPCA concepts using ARMSim and Paracache, and their practical applications in Computer Systems.

## Installation Instructions for macOS

To work on the exercises in this repository, you will need **ARMSim** for coding in ASM. Please refer to my [ARMSim-docker project](https://github.com/Pranavh-2004/ARMSim-docker) to get it setup and running on MacOS.
